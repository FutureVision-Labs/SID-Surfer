# SID-Surfer
SID Surfer is a wave‑riding rhythm game powered by real Commodore 64 SID music (Tiny’R’Sid WASM) and Phaser 3. Surf reactive lanes, switch tracks per lane, pull tricks, collect power‑ups, and face boss fights. Composer profiles, arcade HUD, high scores, and DLC‑ready manifest included. Vite dev/build; GitHub Pages friendly.
