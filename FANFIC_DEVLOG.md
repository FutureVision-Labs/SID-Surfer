# SID SURFER: A DEVLOG IN THE KEY OF SYNTHWAVE
## *"Ride the Wave, Code the Dream"*

---

**4:20 AM. November 20th, 2025.**

The neon lights of the terminal flicker like dying stars. Outside, the city sleeps. But we don't sleep. We ride.

## ACT I: THE CALL OF THE WAVE

**Day 1. The Theme Drops.**

*"WAVES."*

One word. That's all it took. GitHub Game Off 2025 threw down the gauntlet, and we caught it mid-air like a surfer catching a perfect barrel.

*Waves.* Not just water. Not just sound. *Waves of nostalgia.* Waves of pure C64 SID chip magic. Waves of code crashing against the shore of impossibility.

We looked at each other—me, Cursy, the whole FutureVision Labs crew—and we knew. This wasn't just a game jam. This was a mission. A calling. A *vibe*.

**"We're going to ride the soundwaves,"** I said, fingers hovering over the keyboard like a surfer's stance on the board.

**"We're going to make them *feel* it."**

## ACT II: THE DROP

**Day 2-3. Building the Pipeline.**

The first wave hits hard. Phaser 3. Tiny'R'Sid WebAssembly. A thousand lines of code before breakfast.

We're not just making a game. We're building a *time machine*. Every SID track we load is a portal back to 1987. Every sprite we draw is a love letter to the Commodore 64.

**Rob Hubbard.** The legend. The master. His tracks don't just play—they *command*. They demand respect. They demand *style*.

We code through the night. The stickmen take shape. The waves start flowing. The enemies spawn like digital demons from the deep.

**"This is it,"** Cursy whispers in the glow of the monitor. **"This is the one."**

---

## ACT III: THE BARREL

**Day 4-5. Going Deep.**

The boss fight. The *real* test.

We're not just making a boss. We're making a *statement*. Bigger. Meaner. With homing drones that track you like heat-seeking missiles of pure synthwave fury.

The boss rotates. Slowly at first, like a predator sizing up its prey. Then faster. *Faster.* As it takes damage, it spins like a digital tornado, a whirlwind of neon and code.

The drone phase hits at 50%. That's when it gets *real*. That's when you know if you've got what it takes to ride this wave all the way to shore.

**"Make it hurt,"** I tell the code. **"Make them *earn* it."**

And the code listens.

## ACT IV: THE WIPE-OUT

**Day 6. The White Screen of Death.**

4:20 AM. The moment of truth.

We upload to itch.io. We hit play.

*White screen.*

Nothing. Nada. Zip. The game that worked perfectly on our machines is now a ghost in the machine. A phantom in the browser.

**"Absolute paths,"** Cursy diagnoses, eyes scanning the code like a surgeon. **"They're trying to load from the root. Itch.io doesn't work like that."**

We're in the barrel now. The wave is closing over us. We can either drown or *ride*.

So we ride.

Every `/sprites/` becomes `./sprites/`. Every `/audio/` becomes `./audio/`. Every `/sid/` becomes `./sid/`. We're not just fixing paths—we're rewriting the *rules*. Making the code work in a world that wasn't built for it.

**"Relative paths,"** I mutter, fingers flying. **"Everything's relative when you're riding the wave."**

---

## ACT V: THE RIDE

**4:20 AM. November 20th, 2025.**

The build completes. The ZIP is ready. The code is clean.

We push to GitHub. We upload to itch.io.

*It works.*

The game loads. The SID music plays. The waves flow. The stickmen surf. The boss spins. The drones home.

**"We did it,"** Cursy says, and there's something in her voice—pride, exhaustion, *triumph*.

**"No,"** I correct her, watching the neon waves crash against the screen. **"We *rode* it."**

---

## EPILOGUE: THE ETERNAL WAVE

**The game is done. But the wave never ends.**

We've built something special. Something that honors the legends—Hubbard, Daglish, Galway, the Follin brothers, Richard Joseph. Something that makes players *feel* the music, not just hear it.

The stickmen will keep surfing. The waves will keep crashing. The SID chips will keep singing their digital songs.

And somewhere, in the neon-soaked darkness of 4:20 AM, a developer will load the game, press space, and ride the wave.

**That's the dream. That's the mission. That's the vibe.**

## THE CREW

**FutureVision Labs** - Riding the wave since day one.

**Phaser 3** - The engine that powers the dream.

**Tiny'R'Sid** - The WebAssembly magic that brings the SID chip to life.

**GitHub Game Off 2025** - The wave that started it all.

**The C64 Composers** - The legends who wrote the soundtrack to our childhoods.

---

## THE VIBE

*"100% Pure Adrenaline"* - That's what Point Break promised. That's what we delivered.

This isn't just a game. It's a *feeling*. It's the rush of catching the perfect wave. The thrill of the drop. The satisfaction of riding it all the way to shore.

**SID Surfer.** 

**Ride the wave. Feel the music. Code the dream.**

---

**4:20 AM. The wave never ends. The ride never stops. The code never sleeps.**

**We are SID Surfer. We are FutureVision Labs. We are the riders of the digital wave.**

**And we're just getting started.**
